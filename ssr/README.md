# Server Side Rendering

## How SSR works

Whenever you visit a website, your browser makes a request to the server that contains the contents of the website. Once the request is done processing, your browser gets back the fully rendered HTML and displays it on the screen. If you then decide to visit a different page on the website, your browser will once again make another request for the new information. This will occur each and every time you visit a page that your browser does not have a cached version of.

## How CSR works

When developers talk about client-side rendering, theyâ€™re talking about rendering content in the browser using JavaScript. So instead of getting all of the content from the HTML document itself, you are getting a bare-bones HTML document with a JavaScript file that will render the rest of the site using the browser.
