## What is Docker?

Docker is a **containerization** platform that packages your application and all its dependencies together in the form of a docker container to ensure that your application works seamlessly in **any environment**.

For a visual explanation, think of the shipping containers used for intermodal shipping. You put your package (code and dependencies) in the container, ship it using a boat or train (laptop or cloud) and when it arrives at its destination it works (runs) just like it did when it was shipped?

## What is Docker container?

Containers are the ready applications created from Docker Images or you can say a Docker Container is a running instance of a Docker Image and they hold the entire package needed to run the application. This happens to be the ultimate utility of Docker.

## What is Docker Image?

Docker Image can be compared to a template which is used to create Docker Containers. They are the building blocks of a Docker Container. These Docker Images are created using the build command.
