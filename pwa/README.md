# Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

PWAs are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

- Reliable : Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
- Fast : Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
- Engaging : Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.

You can use **Lighthouse** to help you turn a web app into a PWA.

`create-react-app` sets a PWA out of the box for us.

## HTTPS

HTTPS is an extension of HTTP for secure communication over a computer network. The communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security.

HTTPS helps prevent intruders from tampering with the communications between your websites and your usersâ€™ browsers. It also protects the privacy and security of your users.

All sites hosted on GitHub Pages are using HTTPS.

## App manifest

Simple `.json` file that allows us to control how the app should appear in certain areas like in homescreen, how the app should launch, etc.

Tapping on the app will launch a splash screen (background-color and color can be customized)

## Service worker

A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background separate from the web page webapp. It is generally used for features that don't need user interaction.

In a progressive Web app the service worker acts as what we call a network proxy. It intercepts any requests made first to the network.
