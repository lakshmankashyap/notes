# Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

PWAs are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

- Reliable : Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
- Fast : Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
- Engaging : Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.

You can use **Lighthouse** to help you turn a web app into a PWA.

`create-react-app` sets a PWA out of the box for us.
